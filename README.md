# React Europe 2018 Demos

## Getting started

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Go into `src/index.js` and comment or uncomment the different demos and update which one to display in the `root.render`
- If you want to run the "SuspenseImages" demo, generate a github personal access token and put it in `src/suspense-images/token.js` to enable calling the graphql API.
